# Kirby Content Translator (Pro)

This plugin is the evolution of the now deprecated [Kirby Content Translator](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-content-translator) plugin.

We recommend upgrading to the new Kirby Content Translator (Pro) plugin to benefit from the latest features and improvements.

- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Automatically import content from primary language to secondary languages
- ü§ø Recursive translation of nested structures, objects, blocks, etc.
- üë©‚Äçüîß Programmatically translate content server-side
